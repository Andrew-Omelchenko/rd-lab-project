      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>Protecting your Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        InterGreen America, Inc. ("InterGreen" or "we", "us", or "our") is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information collected at or in connection with an InterGreen website. This Online Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to those InterGreen websites that display or link to this Policy (including InterGreen.com/us, miInterGreen.com/us, and InterGreen.com and referred to in this Policy as the "Website"). This Policy applies to data collected by InterGreen through its Websites and services that display these terms. It does not apply to those InterGreen sites, services and products that do not display or link to this Policy or that have their own privacy policies. This Policy describes the information we collect and how we use it. By visiting our Website, you are accepting the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Website.

      <h2>Consent to Collection and Processing</h2>
      <p>
        This Website may be operated, in whole or in part, from a country other than the United States. By using our Website, you consent to having your personal information transferred to and processed in a jurisdiction outside of the United States.
      </p>
      <h2>What Information about me does InterGreen.com collect and store?</h2>
      <p>
        Our privacy policy is simple: Except as disclosed below, we don't sell, trade, give away, or rent your personal information to any company outside of the InterGreen Group. One of the basic principles we've tried to follow in designing this Website is to limit the information we collect from and share about you.
      </p>
      <h2>Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        We collect and store information that you provide to our Website or our Customer Service Department or that we receive from third parties (such as companies providing commercially available databases). For example, when you place an order, we collect and store some or all of the following information that you provide: name, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, and credit card number and expiration date. If you sign up for an InterGreen account, which allows you to use the same sign-in details anywhere in the world, we will ask for your name, e-mail address, date of birth and password. We will also collect the following additional information, if you choose to provide it when you sign-up for an account: telephone number, gender, personal preferences, social identifier if you choose to log in to your account via social media and age. We collect your e-mail addresses and zip code if you subscribe to our newsletter and we collect your mobile number if you opt in to receive text messages. You may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions located within each newsletter or linked to each text message. We also collect and store your geolocation information. Registration may be required and personal information collected in certain areas of the Website in which you specifically and knowingly provide such information, e.g. community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or customer service requests. When we run a contest or sweepstakes relating to our Website, it will be accompanied by a set of rules. The rules for each contest/sweepstakes will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed, if it is different than as described in this Policy. Personal information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it to our sponsors or us.
      </p>
      <h2>Usage Information</h2>
      <p>
        Through your use of our Website, we may also gather certain information about your use of our Website ("Usage Information"). Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data".

      <h2>How does InterGreen.com use cookies, advertising, and online tracking?</h2>
      <p>
        Like many websites, we use "cookies", files stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser to identify account holders and to optimize their shopping experience. Cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when a user leaves this Website without checking out and send you reminder e-mail about your shopping orders and other shopping opportunities. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better shopping experience. You may occasionally get cookies from companies advertising on our behalf to tailor advertisements shown to you for goods and services. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our Website. Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals, but several of our service providers who utilize these cookies and other tracking technologies on our Website enable you to opt out of this type of advertising. For more information about third party cookies, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp or www.aboutads.info/choices/.
      <p>
        We use Google Analytics and Google AdWords on the Website to collect Usage Information, to analyze how users use the Website and to provide advertisements to you on other websites.  For more information about how to opt out of having your information used by Google Analytics, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.  You can learn more about advertising and online tracking and how to opt out of such practices in the paragraph above.
      </p>
      <h2>Interest-Based Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        We also use third party companies, including Google Analytics and Google Adwords, to measure and target ads on our behalf about products and services tailored to your interests. We allow these third-party companies to use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar technologies to collect or receive information about your interaction with us on our Website and elsewhere on the internet (“Tracking Data”) and use such Tracking Data to display ads for InterGreen and other companies when you visit this or other websites.

      <p>
        We may use your personal information to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to provide customer service, to provide other services to you, and to personalize the Website, our communications with you, and your shopping experience. For example, when you create an InterGreen account, you can use your account details to log in from any location and on any device. The global single sign-on for your account will allow InterGreen systems to identify you wherever you are, so you will not need to register with us again if you sign in from a different country. Your information also may be used to contact you about sales, new products, new site features, special offers, and personalized offers based on your location, unless you have opted to not receive promotional communications. The information we collect may be combined with information obtained from companies within the InterGreen Group and from other companies. We may also combine this information with other information we collect as you interact with our brand across apps, social media and marketing messages we send you. Aggregating data allows InterGreen to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide you with product recommendations and special offers.
